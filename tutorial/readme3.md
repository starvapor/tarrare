Now that things are setup, we can actually look at and edit our code!

If you're using libGDX, the hierarchy is going to be a bit different than the usual.

Typically, [this](http://www.kilobolt.com/day-4-parts-of-an-android-application.html) is your structure. This hierarchy is still there in the android folder. However, you won't be directly editing this, you'll be editing the core Java that is .. in the core folder.

Let's open up your base code by navigating to your equivalent of `Tarrare-core > src > com.starvapor.tarrare > tarrare2d.java`. Double-click on `tarrare2d.java` and you can see your code!!
